## Documentation

### How to download?

Click [here] (https://github.com/modInfo/flarum-i18n-polish/archive/master.zip) or on the *Download ZIP* button in the right panel, as simple as that!

### How to install?

Once the compressed extension downloaded, you will need to extract the archive.


Using [FTP] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), you will need to browse into your Flarum root (which contains the config.php file). You will see an *extensions/* directory. Inside this directory, you have to create a *polish/* directory. Then, upload the content of the previous extracted archive inside the *polish/* directory.


Now that the extension is uploaded to your server, you will have to install it. Log-in to your forum and click on your username at the top right of the screen. You will see a pop-up, and you have to click on the *Administration* link. Once in the administration page, you will have to click on *Extensions*. Then, once in the extensions page, you will see the grey tinted *Polish* extension, with an icon of the Earth and a blue background. Hover the extension and you will see a dotted vertical menu. Click on the vertical menu and click on *Enable*.

Your Polish extension is now installed. Congratulations! You and your users can select the language via a dropdown menu located in the header, at the right of the search box.

### How to update?

Once the updated compressed extension downloaded, you will need to extract the archive.

Using [FTP] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), you will need to browse into your Flarum root (which contains the config.php file). You have to access to your *extensions/* directory, and to the *polish/* directory. Inside this directory, upload the new files by replacing the old ones.


Your Polish localization extension is now updated. But you have to clear the cache of your forum. Using [FTP] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), you will need to browse into your Flarum root and to locate the *assets/* directory. Inside the directory, you will see a *forum-pl-XYZ.js*, with XYZ as random letters and numbers. Please delete this file.placing the old files by the new ones. That's it, congratulations!
